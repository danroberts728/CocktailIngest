# Cocktail Ingest (Multi‑Source Scraper + Canonicalizer)

This scaffold lets you scrape cocktail recipes from multiple sources (starting with IBA), store each **recipe version** with full **attribution**, and merge them into **canonical cocktails** that can present a source‑agnostic view while linking back to the originals.
